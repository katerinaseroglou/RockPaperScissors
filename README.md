# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors (UI Version)

This is a **Rock Paper Scissors** game built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, as part of  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curse.

The original project was console-based and relied heavily on `prompt()` and `alert()`.  
This version has been **extended and refactored** to use **DOM manipulation** and a **fully interactive UI**.
